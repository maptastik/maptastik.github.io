BBHHTA BootLeaf Project
========

This is an adaptation of Bryan McBride's Bootleaf template. It's a great combo of site design via [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), mapping via [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), and search functionality via [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/). The project here is an adaptation of the orignal Bootleaf template so that users can see, toggle, and search different trails and trail heads being proposed by the Bluegrass Hike Bike and Horseback Trail Alliance in Scott County, Kentucky.
